										<h2>Launching into Computer Science</h2>
										<p>Summary</p>
									</header>
									<p>Current advancements in computing technology have emerged as tools that enhance personal and corporate capabilities. People use computing applications to perform daily activities; we see the use of computers in all aspects of our life. For example, we experience the use of computing for innovation, corporate optimisation and performance enhancement, research, communications and even for socialisation (Schryen, 2013).
										<br /><br />
										We see in today’s world that a large amount of data is utilised for predictions, for modelling scenarios and for trend analysis in real-time, increasing human and corporate efficiencies (Borne, 2013). Moreover, computing professionals collect and analyse big data sets from social media, i.e., Facebook and Twitter, in order to pull and push demands for corporate decision-making, innovations and for strategic competitive advantages (Trucolo & Digiampietri, 2017). However, enhanced computing performance requires a perfect environment where state-of-the art hardware components, software as a tool and fine designed algorithms all work together and platforms are developed using different IT-based business models (Dos Santos et al., 2017).
										<br /><br />
										Consequently, taking into account the computing technology solutions, we develop a digital society through e-commercialisation and it contributes to the development of a global community (Dos Santos et al., 2017). That is the reason we see in today’s world computing solutions like, network technology, cloud computing, grid computing, parallel computing, artificial intelligence, data warehousing and data mining, just to name a few.</p>
										<br /><br />
										<p>This module looks at providing knwledge and understanding on the following; <br />
											<br />- Identify and explain the architecture, structure and functionality of basic components of computer system
											<br />- Demonstrate a critical understanding of core data structures and programming concepts, including algorithm computability
											<br />- Critically evaluate the functionality of different types of software, i.e., operating system, utility programs, languages and applications.
											<br />- Critically appraise the emerging trends in the field, such as cloud computing, big data, cyber security, and the professional and ethical requirements for dealing with such contemporary computer-based technologies.</p>

									<h3>Comments & Reflections</h3>
									<p>
										This module expresses one of my primary motivations for registering to this masters course. I find that a lot of times the development stages of software
										can be so much of the focus of a project that certain key importance are ignored. I have come accross several systems where I just know the developer(s) 
										missed out understanding the domain or planning out all events. I believe what makes a system robust and complete is its ability to meet future demands
										without breaking. Not to neccessarily be able to handle every future event since that is impossible (it is called the future for a reason) but for it
										to at the least maintain its functionality and purpose. For instance, the Y2K (millenium bug) may just repeat itself if systems are not well thought out.
										Yes the demand for systems to be developed quick exists but perhaps a new approach to reviewing development projects after its launch. Something to consider 
										for my PHD after this course.

														<h3>Object Oriented Information System</h3>
														As powerful as python is, the question is still raised if it can really be considered as an OOP supported language. 
														OOP has 5 main concepts (Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Classes and Objects, and Inheritance) although some 
														would argue to say there are other concepts but generally my argument would be
														the other presented arguments of addition are practically things you must include anyway. example of such a concept
														is methods. Methods would have to be implemented in a class anyway so separating them in my view is as compared to 
														a TV without a viewing possibility. Its possibly what the world calls a radio and not a TV.
														<br /><br />
														Now considering that these 5 OOP concepts are about the core of defining a language to be OOP supported or not, 
														the absence of abstraction in python makes it fall short of the actual concept. Yes, there are alternatives to implementing abstraction
														but since this is not explicit and leans more on conventions than the possibility of enforcing rules, it still remains a short coming.
														<br /><br />
														I however find it still advantageous. In my experience of working with OOP, implementing a unit test becomes mostly difficult with the 
														presence of abstractions and the singleton design pattern. Most languages recently are providing possibilities to being able to still access
														or test abstracted methods in a class which goes back to defy the original NO ACCESS concept of abstraction, which comes back again to 
														question the very start of the idea of implementing abstractions in the first place. The question of are they really relevant also comes in. 
														The only possibility of accessing any code at all is within a development team and so a convention would sem to be more relevant than an enforcement.
														Developments should not be treated as users in the first place.
														<br /><br />
														Of course, the above can all be argued again. Which brings us to a conclusion of preference. Perhaps in the future we will have a bit more freedom to decide
														if we want to implement an enforced abstraction environment or just conventions. till then, we simply change public to private or vice versa and keep going.

														<h3>System Design - UML</h3>
														<p>
															It is first of all worth noting that UMLs are not the entire design process of a software design or planning cycle,
															There are a lot more that spans through and includes user stories, developer stories and more. However having this,
															proves to be very useful. At a point in my life I loved to just implement ideas as they came which may seem to be
															a more agile way to finish a project but the cost of having to revisit completed parts of a project with the code
															breaks and system failures, I come to realize that it gives more value when we carefully plan a system, consider 
															all outcomes, ensure we have considered all possibilities, the domain is well understood and even as it is impossible to
															know all outcomes, the most of it is thought of. This process saves time and money. And even in a SCRUM environment,
															a visit to previous parts of the system, prevents breaks and we can have a running system even with patches and major modifications.
