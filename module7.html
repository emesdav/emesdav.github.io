										<h2>Research Methods and Professional Practice</h2>
										<p>Summary</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										During this module, I have come to appreciate much more the need for research and professional practices while gaining valuable skills in statistical analysis, which have enhanced my understanding of data collection and interpretation. I have learned how to use various statistical tools to analyze data, such as descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. These skills are essential for making informed decisions based on data, which is critical for professional practice in various fields.

														<h3>Initial Post</h3>
														<p>Case study: <a href="https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-medical-implant-risk-analysis/">Case: Medical Implant Risk Analysis
														</a></p>
														<p>
															The scenario involving Corazón, a medical technology startup that develops an implantable heart health monitoring device, provides an example of the application of ethical principles in the development and use of technology. 
															<br />
															Per the CEPC principles Corazón has demonstrated good ethics and competence by providing free to reduced access to patients living below the poverty line, gaining approvals from various national authority agencies, allowed security evaluations, and worked with charity organizations to serve possibly excluded individuals.
															<br />															
															However, the case also raises concerns about the use of a hard-coded value in the implant, which may pose a risk to patients if the flaw cannot be fixed (Zhou & Lu, 2019). This issue highlights the importance of conducting thorough risk analysis and considering the long-term implications of technology design choices.
															<br />
															The BCS Code of Conduct similarly requires professionals to prioritize the interests of society, to work within the law, to promote the public good, and to maintain the security and confidentiality of information (BCS, 2018). The BCS Code also requires professionals to act with integrity, to ensure the quality of their work, and to act with objectivity in their professional activities.
															<br />
															In conclusion, the scenario involving Corazón highlights the importance of ethical considerations in the development and use of technology. By following the principles of the CEPC and the BCS Code of Conduct, computing professionals can help ensure that technology is developed and used in a responsible and safe manner.

														<h3>Case Study and Initial Post</h3>
														<p><b>Case study:</b> <br />
															Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.
															<br />
															Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”
															<br />
															Ethical Concerns
															
															<br />- Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?
															<br />- Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?
															<br />- Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?
															<br />- If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?
														</p>
													<br /><br />
														<p> <b>Initial Post:</b><br />
															Abi's situation raises ethical concerns about the accuracy and transparency of information in research. As a researcher and statistical programmer, Abi has a responsibility to present truthful and unbiased information, regardless of the findings (Resnik, 2015). Therefore, it is not ethical for Abi to suggest analyzing correct data in a way that supports multiple conclusions, as this would be misleading and could have serious consequences for public health.
															<br />
															Moreover, Abi is obligated to present both positive and negative analyses to the manufacturer, as this would allow them to make an informed decision about the nutritional value of Whizzz (Resnik, 2015). Abi should also inform the manufacturer about the potential risks associated with the cereal, even if it may negatively impact their sales. By doing so, Abi would uphold the principles of transparency and honesty in research, and would avoid contributing to the dissemination of false or misleading information.
															<br />
															If Abi were to alter the data or present biased results, he could face legal consequences, damage his professional reputation, and undermine public trust in research (Shamoo & Resnik, 2015). Conversely, if Abi were to present accurate and transparent results, he could contribute to the advancement of science and public health, and strengthen his professional integrity. And if he suspects that the manufacturer will only publicize the positive results, he could publish his findings in a scientific journal, share his data with other researchers, or report the manufacturer's behavior to regulatory authorities (Resnik, 2015).
															<br />
															In conclusion, Abi's situation highlights the importance of accuracy, transparency, and responsibility in research. As a researcher and statistical programmer, Abi has a duty to uphold these principles, even if it may conflict with the interests of the manufacturer or his own biases. By doing so, Abi would contribute to the advancement of science and public health, and fulfill his professional and ethical obligations.
