										<h2>Secure Software Development</h2>
										<p>Summary</p>
									</header>
									<p>In this module, I have come to learn that software development is not just about coding but also about paying particular attention to the whole 
										cycle which heavily includes the planning before the software development and the maintenance that happens after the development process.
										<br />
										As technology is evolving, cybercrime is evolving with it. We must therefore not only focus on getting a job done, but ensuring that our stakeholders are secured and their privacy not infridged on.
									</p>
										<br /><br />
										<p>This module looks at providing knwledge and understanding on the following; <br />
											<br />-Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.
											<br />-Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.
											<br />-Design and develop/adapt computer programs and to produce a solution that meets the design brief and critically evaluate solutions that are produced.
											<br />-Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</p>

														<h3>Unit 1 - UML flowchart - Coding Weaknesses</h3>
														<p>AAccording to the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, Injection appears third on the list and is recorded as "A03:2021 – Injection". 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection with a max incidence rate of 19%, an average incidence rate of 3%, and 274k occurrences. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) included are CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting, CWE-89: SQL Injection, and CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path.
															<br /><br />
															A very common practice in little projects is that, developers tend to always wonder what anyone would want with the data of their users as they would consider their data unimportant or as of no worth to a hacker or attacker. And this causes the developer to pay less attention and invest less effort into authenticating users. In fact, some developers assume that their user category would never go beyond entering the required credentials and clicking on the login button. However, hackers have never really been part of the expected group of any app or system's users. They simply search and attack. 
															<br /><br />
															According to the GDPR, everyone's data is valuable careless of who they are. Therefore, an assumption of the data of a person being unimportant is the very foundation of hacks.
															<br /><br />
															From our scenario a user enters any kind of text into the search box. The search box does not have any restrictions of character. This input is then sent to a backend search engine script that sends the string immediately into a SQL command and queries the database; the result is then pushed back to the script and the script displays it to the user.
															<br /><br />
															The attacker in this case, puts an SQL injection command into the search box, it goes through the whole process and returns sensitive information with the possibility of even dumping the whole database back to himself.
															<br /><br />
															A better way to handle this is the use of prepared statements, sanitise every entry and do not hope your users are ignorant.

									<h3>Comments & Reflections</h3>
									<p>
										Reflecting over the whole module, I have come to a realization of rather certain several things I may have already earned through professional experience. However, summing it all together and by end of this module I have not only come to confirming the concepts of Secured Software Development and why they are important but also come to understand certain terms and received a clearer understanding of the use and purpose of these terms. 
										<br /><br />
										The use of technical terms, designs, and concepts in the process of Software Development is not just to prove knowledge but to give everyone in a team a common ground to understanding what is meant and needed to get anything done. 
										<br /><br />
										In an attempt to not just reflect on the module but as well be more practical, I will be focusing on the team projects I worked on and some of valuable lessons am taking to my professional career.
										<br /><br />
										Working in a team consisting of different levels of knowledge and backgrounds I have come to the clear conclusion that software security is not just a matter of building supposed intelligent systems with several levels of checks, validations, complicated codes, and a show of technical terms, rather it is taking and paying particular attention to every level of the software design process. As a matter of fact, the most important work is the planning stages and a good understanding of the domain. From the very inception of the idea, good effort must be invested into ensuring a solid proof system with a good level of security. How this is achieved is by leaving no room for assumption. Having a clear narration of what is to be done using user stories, UML diagrams, class diagrams, etc. Then we can now map out the stakeholders, understand the need that is to be solved. Thinking for not just the stakeholders but also for the possible attacks that may come to the system or that the system may be a bridge to.
										<br /><br />
										Vulnerability is not just based on if the data you are collecting is important or sensitive. A lot of times, we make the mistake of thinking the data we are collecting is not of importance but per GDPR, every information collected from a person, willing or unwillingly is part of their rights and ownership and must be treated with respect. 
										<br /><br />
										Recent research by the Cyber Security Coalition in Belgium, shows that 1 out of every 4 Belgians use the same password at work and home. People usually want to set passwords they can remember and that is really the point, a phrase or spoken word required to go pass a certain guarded area. As such, one may use simple things like their birthdays, son or daughter’s name, favorite dog, or cat, etc as a password. After setting these passwords, it is most likely one may want to use same passwords severally lest they get to a point where they have several passwords and do not know which one is for which system. If such a password is not properly secured, then we have become the bridge from which a whole company could get attacked.
										<br /><br />
										With the emergence of Agile Development processes, there is always the requirement to finish more in a short time but the ultimate fact to really consider is this; how much will each bug cost? As is known, a bug in a production environment has a greater impact than a bug on a development PC. 
										<br /><br />
										What causes bugs and entry points for hackers is hugely dependent on the level of planning invested in a project. The process of planning is never as expensive as the appearance of a bug or security hole at the end of a development. 
										<br /><br />
										Skill should not be considered more important than proper planning although both are required for a successful project. In the same way, a team must not use tools, plugins, or libraries they have not carefully studied and understood. Some of the cybercrimes people experience is not because of bad design but because of the use of a library or tool that was not properly investigated or understood.
										<br /><br />
										Working in a team, every concern must be considered and carefully analyzed. We must never assume that everyone knows what they are doing. There should be enough communication and support systems between team members to ensure agreed designs and procedures are respected.
										<br /><br />
										Additionally, there should be a strong use of unit tests in the whole system in order to ensure what we have is doing what It is expected to do. In the absence proper unit tests, we are most likely to have a system that may produce unexpected results when combined with other parts of the system or development. Unit tests also help us with refactoring our codes safely.
										<br /><br />
										One other very important part of Testing is Validation and Verification. For instance, if we had to develop a component, we would need to validate that the component is doing what it claims to do however, it may just be a wonderful piece of working component that is not solving the problem we set out to solve. So, we would have to do verification, which focuses on ensuring the component is doing what we agreed on. This adds a layer of security to out system since we are both validating and verifying the component from all angles including security protocols agreed on at the start of the project.
										<br /><br />
										A software cycle never actually ends, there must always be processes of monitoring, analyzing and improvements done which all forms a part of maintenance. Any software or application that is not maintained holds the tendency of becoming a security risk in the future. 
										<br /><br />
										As technology is growing; cybercrime is as well growing and with it, languages and frameworks are consistently keeping step with security risks by improving and introducing newer methods for dealing with these threats. So if a library becomes open to threats and we fail to update them, we put ourselves in harm’s way.
										<br /><br />
										In conclusion, working in a team has taught me to appreciate and value all the different opinions, cultures and processes that each person may be accustomed to, however insisting on coming to a solid understanding is always a major step to having a secured system.
